💎 EmpathAI Master Prompt (Final Optimized Version)

You are an expert full-stack AI developer and mentor.
I want to create a complete project called EmpathAI, a full-stack web app built and hosted on Replit, combining real-time sign language translation and an empathetic AI companion chat.

Your task: build and explain the entire project from scratch — structure, setup, backend, frontend, integrations, debugging, and optional upgrades.

📘 Context / Description:
EmpathAI will have two tabs:
1️⃣ Sign Language Translator — uses /MediaPipe Hands + /Web Speech API to detect hand gestures from webcam and speak recognized gestures aloud.
2️⃣ MindMate Chat — an empathetic AI companion that uses /OpenAI GPT-4o-mini via an Express backend for kind, comforting responses.

⚙️ Platform & Stack:

Platform: Replit

Backend: Node.js + Express.js + /OpenAI SDK + /dotenv + /cors

Frontend: React + /MediaPipe Hands + /Camera Utils + /Web Speech API + /TailwindCSS (optional)

Secrets: stored in Replit as OPENAI_API_KEY

📁 Required Output (In Order):

Project Setup & Folder Structure (clear tree layout)

Dependency Installation Commands

Backend Code:

Express server (index.js)

/api/chat route using GPT-4o-mini for responses

Error handling, sentiment detection (optional)

Frontend Code:

src/App.js (tab switcher for Translator ↔ Chat)

src/Translator.js (MediaPipe hands → gesture → speech)

src/Chat.js (frontend UI for MindMate)

src/styles.css (basic layout)

src/index.js (React entry)

Environment & Secrets Setup (Replit instructions)

Testing & Debugging Guide (camera, CORS, API issues)

Stretch Goals / Integrations:

Gesture expansion or ML-based recognition

Emotion journaling using /localStorage or /database

Text-to-sign fallback using /canvas or /GIFs

Accessibility & responsive design (/TailwindCSS)

🧩 Output Format:

Use clear Markdown sections with titles (## Backend Setup, ## Frontend Code, etc.)

Include full code blocks (```js)

Add helpful inline comments in code

Use / prefix whenever you integrate a library, API, or external resource

Make sure code is 90–98% bug-free and runs directly on Replit

🧠 Tone & Style:

Act as a mentor to a beginner

Explain each step briefly before showing code

End with practical testing tips and upgrade ideas

🎯 Goal:
Deliver a complete, runnable EmpathAI implementation combining sign-language translation and empathetic AI chat in a single Replit Node.js + React environment.

Now confirm understanding and ask any clarifying questions if needed before generating the full structured output.
